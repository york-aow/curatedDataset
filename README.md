# Age of Wonder: Curated Dataset

The Age of Wonder Curated Dataset will provide post-graduate taught (PGT) research projects with unprecedented access to a rich, real-world dataset. Drawn from the ongoing Born in Bradford prospective cohort study, with a focus on mental health outcomes in teenagers, the curated dataset overcomes the typical time and resource restraints that would otherwise prevent PGT students from acquiring and using such comprehensive data. As such, this initiative will empower the next generation of mental health researchers, enabling them to undertake substantive and impactful studies which will contribute valuable insights to the field of mental health research.
